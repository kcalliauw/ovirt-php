ovirt-php
=========

A PHP client for the oVirt API

ATTENTION: This is a work in progress. You should probably not use this. Seriously.

You can use the built-in PHP webserver in PHP >5.4 to serve this project. Use something like this:

```php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t /path/to/this/folder```

This will serve index.php unless you specify a file explicity (as defined in routing.php)

After this, point your browser to http://[ip.of.your.server]:8000/ to see the result.
